The SQL query uses a `CASE` statement within a `WHERE` clause to filter results, but the `CASE` statement's result is not compared to a value for filtering. This will result in an error or unexpected results because the conditional logic isn't correctly used within the filter.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE CASE
    WHEN department = 'Sales' THEN 1
    WHEN department = 'Marketing' THEN 1
    ELSE 0
END;
```

This query attempts to filter for employees in 'Sales' or 'Marketing', but it fails to define a condition like `WHERE ... = 1`.  The CASE statement will evaluate to 0 or 1, but this result is not actually used in the WHERE clause for filtering.
